      "No shit. I saw a group of people doing some strange things in the woods near my house. They burned someone alive. <br> <br> Yesterday, during night, me and my brother heard some loud noises from the forest behind our house. Something like loud bush rumble. Then I wanted to went out of the house to check the sound. I was afraid it was the sound of a bear trying to get out of the forest. My brother insisted on coming along because he was afraid of being alone at home. Our parents still hadn't come home from work. I took my flashlight, locked the door, and went straight to woods with my brother. <br> <br> In the forest, we did not see any bears, or any wild animals. But we saw many- a group of people in white robe, forming a circle. We are in confusion, but also curious. I turned off my flashlight and we went into full silent mode to see what they would do. But, somehow, my brother has been acting weird recently.",

She brought in some familiar items for... committing suicide, such as a rope and a chair. I kept watching the stream, wondering if this was a real situation or just a cheap prank. As the stream progressed, the number of viewers steadily grew. Not many of them even asked for the woman to actually commit suicide. And yup, after the viewers reached 10.000, she actually committed suicide by jumping from the chair with the rope tied around her neck. She was... hanging, in front of the camera.",

There was no clear family heir among Claudio’s three children. When the third child doesn’t give any sh*t, the first and second child are in conflict arguing about who is worthy to be the 8th head of the family. <br> <br> The first child, Ulrico Salvatore is known as a cruel leader but he is a firm person and very strict to the rules. The second child, Federico Salvatore is known as a kind leader, very protective of his people, but he can be too soft sometimes. The third child, Claudia Salvatore is just happen to be there. <br> <br> Because of this “vacuum of power” and family conflict condition, the situation of ###’s people is getting heated too. Many people support Federico to be the 8th leader, but the people who support Ulrico are also no less numerous. Well, there are some people that don’t give any sh*t just like Claudia.",
